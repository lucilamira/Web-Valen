</ul>
<p>I have also applied:</p>
<ul>
  <li>media queries <em>(at the time this project was made, I have not reached to the chapter where theory for responsive design is explained but needed it for my project hence I searched in other projects from previous course but still need to learn more about this)</em> to make the site responsive for mobile devices</li>
  <li>A contact button that redirects to my Whatsapp number</li>
